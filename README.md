## Spendr

Spendr is a sophisticated expense tracker application built using Next.js, Clerk authentication, and Prisma ORM. It is designed to empower users with efficient tools for managing their finances effectively.

Developed on the Next.js framework, Spendr leverages server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities to ensure fast loading times and optimal performance. It utilizes Next.js API routes for seamless backend operations, enabling robust data handling and interaction.

Authentication and user management are handled securely by Clerk. This ensures that users can access Spendr with confidence, utilizing their preferred social accounts or email addresses for authentication.

Prisma ORM serves as the backbone for Spendr's data management, providing a type-safe and efficient interface for database operations. With Prisma, Spendr supports comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to manage their expense records seamlessly.

Spendr prioritizes a seamless and secure financial tracking experience, offering a modern interface that enhances usability and accessibility. Whether users are tracking personal expenses or managing budgets collaboratively, Spendr provides the tools necessary for informed financial decision-making.
